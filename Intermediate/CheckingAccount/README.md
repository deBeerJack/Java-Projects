🏦 Java Checking Account Console App  
A simple Java console application that simulates a bank’s checking account system. This project demonstrates my understanding of Java OOP, user input handling, arrays, and error checking in a real-world scenario.

🛠️ What It Does  
- Lets users view all accounts and their details  
- Deposit and withdraw money from accounts  
- Transfer funds between accounts  
- View transaction history for each account  
- Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) and custom interest rates  
- Demonstrates input validation and error handling

🚀 How to Run  
1. Compile all `.java` files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac *.java`).  
2. Run the program with `java Main` in your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the bank system.

💡 Skills Demonstrated  
- Java basics: classes, objects, arrays, enums, methods  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): encapsulation, modularity  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Console application structure and user interaction
