🏦 Java Checking Account Console App  
A simple Java console application that simulates a bank’s checking account system. This project demonstrates my understanding of Java OOP, user input handling, arrays, and error checking in a real-world scenario.

🛠️ What It Does  
- Check the accounts balance  
- Deposit and withdraw money from accounts  
- Transfer funds between accounts  
- View transaction history for each account  
- Switch between accounts without restarting the program  
- Close an account (if balance is zero)  
- Access administrative features (apply fees, apply monthly interest, view all accounts) via a dedicated submenu  
- Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) and custom interest rates  
- Demonstrates robust input validation and error handling

🚀 How to Run  
1. Compile all `.java` files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac *.java`).  
2. Run the program with `java Main` in your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the bank system.

💡 Skills Demonstrated  
- Java basics: classes, objects, arrays, enums, methods  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): encapsulation, modularity  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Console application structure and user interaction

📚 Why This Project?  
This project reinforces my understanding of Java syntax, OOP principles, and best practices. It provides a practical demonstration of how to manage accounts, handle user input, and structure a modular Java application.  
It’s a foundational exercise as part of my journey to become a junior software developer.  
It's a revised practice exercise from a Codecademy tutorial.

📝 Design Note: Arrays vs. ArrayList
This project uses a fixed-size array to store accounts in the `Bank` class. This approach was chosen intentionally to demonstrate core Java concepts such as manual array management, indexing, and resizing logic. In real-world Java applications, you would typically use a dynamic data structure like `ArrayList<CheckingAccount>` for better scalability and easier management.

If you are reviewing this project as a prospective employer or collaborator, please note that I am familiar with Java Collections and can easily adapt this code to use `ArrayList` or other data structures as needed. The use of arrays here is for educational purposes and to reinforce my understanding of Java fundamentals.
